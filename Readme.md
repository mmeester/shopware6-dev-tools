# Shopware 6 Additional Dev Tools

A small stack of dev tools to make your life as a starting Shopware 6 developer a little easier

#### Assumptions

This plugin is build upon a few assumptions:

- You have Shopware 6 already installed manually
- `shopware/platform` is installed by composer

## Installation

### Composer / packagist
```
composer require mmeester/shopware6-dev-tools
```
That's it, follow the next steps in the [activate plugin](#activate-plugin) section.

### Manual
- Download the zipfile of this repo
- Unzip the zip
- Rename the folder to `DevTools` or whatevever your flavor is
- Move the folder in your Shopware 6 Custom plugin directory, ex:  `custom/plugins`

### Activate plugin
In your CLI run the following inside the root of your Shopware project:

- Detect new plugins: `bin/console plugin:refresh`  ðŸ‘‰ Look for the new plugin 
- Install & activate the plugin: ` bin/console plugin:install --activate DevTools`

## Enable or disable Twig Caching
Before you can start developing you need to disable twig caching so development goes faster (and your installation a little slower), to disable the cache run:

```
bin/console dev:twig-cache disable
```

to enable the cache:

```
bin/console dev:twig-cache enable
```
  
## Hot proxy fix

This is a fix for Shopware 6 users that aren't able or don't want to use Docker to run their installation locally. 

This solves the problem in Valet+ that it isn't accepting port :80 forwarding with hot proxy!

- Run the new command to fix the hot-proxy: `bin/console dev:hot-proxy-fix`
- Try the hot-proxy again by running the standard Shopware command: `./psh.phar custom:fix-proxy`
